# YuGiOh CSV Updater
 
Many people participating in a "Progression Series" of YuGiOh online with a group use db.ygoprodeck.com to open packs and manage their collection. 
However as time goes on the complexity of the cards and as their collection grows it becomes increasingly difficult to find specific cards or interactions between cards using the default collection viewer.
 
This program takes the downloaded default card collection .csv file from your account on db.ygoprodeck.com and creates a new one with additional headers and information of each line/card in the original .csv file.
This allows for a greater ability to search for specific cards and synergies in your collection.  

# Using the program:

In order to use it, simply run the .exe in the same directory as "Card Collection.csv" in which an updated "New Card Collection.csv" will be created.
