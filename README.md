# YuGiOh CSV Updater
 
Takes the default card collection .csv file from your account on db.ygoprodeck.com and creates a new once with additional headers and information of each line/card in the original .csv file.

In order to use it simply run the .exe in the same directory as "Card Collection.csv" in which an updated "New Card Collection.csv" will be created.
